  Small code example, demonstrating some of possible distributions policies, using soft-select.
  
  Defining multiple kinds of struct, very similar to each other. The only
  difference -  their distribution
  
 The screenshots show the coverage result of running the example code. As you can see - some policies result with an even distriburtion, some put weight on the edges. For each fields you can decide which distribution better achieves your verificaiton goals, and write the  soft-select accordingly.
